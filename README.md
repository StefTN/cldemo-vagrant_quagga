## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is CLDEMO-VAGRANT?
CLDEMO-VAGRANT is the name of this repository which provides a consistent 
physical topology of VMs which are cabled together in a configuration 
we refer to as the [Reference Topology](#what-is-the-reference-topology). This topology provides a 
consistent simulation topology upon which lots of different configurations 
can be overlaid. The [individual demos](#available-demos) provide interface and routing protocol 
configurations which are applied to this simulation topology.

### What is the Reference Topology?
The Cumulus Linux Demo Framework is built upon a [Vagrantfile](#what-is-a-vagrantfile) which builds 
the Reference Topology. Using this topology, it is possible to demonstrate 
any feature in Cumulus Linux. It may not be necessary to use all links or 
all devices but they're present if needed by a particular demo.

This framework of demos is built on a two-tier spine-leaf [Clos network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clos_network) with a
dedicated out-of-band management network. The Reference Topology built in 
this repository is used for all Cumulus Networks documentation, demos, 
and course materials, so many demos will require you to build a topology 
using the code available in this repository.

### What is Cumulus VX?
This repository makes use of [Cumulus VX](https://cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-vx/) which is a virtual machine
produced by Cumulus Networks to simulate the user experience of configuring a switch using the Cumulus Linux network operating system.

### What is Vagrant?
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is an open source tool for quickly
deploying large topologies of virtual machines. Vagrant and [Cumulus VX](#what-is-cumulus-vx) can be
used together to build virtual simulations of production networks to validate
configurations, develop automation code, and simulate failure scenarios.

Vagrant uses [Vagrantfiles](#what-is-a-vagrantfile) to represent the topology.

### What is a Vagrantfile?
Vagrant topologies are described in a text file called a "Vagrantfile," 
which is also the filename. A Vagrantfile is a Ruby program that
tells Vagrant which devices to create and how to configure their networks.
`vagrant up` will execute the Vagrantfile and create the reference topology
using Virtualbox. 

### What is Libvirt/KVM?
Libvirt/KVM is a high-performance hypervisor that is used on Linux systems **ONLY**.
[Vagrantfiles](#what-is-a-vagrantfile) for the Libvirt/KVM hypervisor are also included in this repository.
To use them you need to be using a Linux system and follow the [Linux setup instructions](./documentation/linux).

Libvirt/KVM offers several notable advantages over Virtualbox:
* There is no interface limit (virtualbox limits VMs to 36 interfaces)
* VMs can be started in Parallel which greatly reduces simulation startup time

As a result this tends to be the most common hypervisor for larger simulations.

### Which Software Versions Should I Use?
Software versions are always changing. At the time of this writing the following 
versions are known to work well: 
* Vagrant v1.9.5
* Virtualbox v5.1.22
* Libvirt v1.3.1

### What Is The Out Of Band Server Doing?
The following tasks are completed to make using the topology more convenient.

 * DHCP, DNS, and Apache are installed and configured on the oob-mgmt-server
 * Static MAC address entries are added to DHCP on the oob-mgmt-server for all devices
 * A bridge is created on the oob-mgmt-switch to connect all devices eth0 interfaces together
 * A private key for the Cumulus user is installed on the oob-mgmt-server
 * Public keys for the cumulus user are installed on all of the devices, allowing passwordless ssh
 * A NOPASSWD stanza is added for the cumulus user in the sudoers file of all devices

After the topology comes up, we use `vagrant ssh` to log in to the management
device and switch to the `cumulus` user. The `cumulus` user is able to access
other devices (leaf01, spine02) in the network using its SSH key, and has
passwordless sudo enabled on all devices to make it easy to run administrative
commands. Further, most automation tools (Ansible, Puppet, Chef) are run
from this management server. **Most demos assume that you are logged into
the out of band management server as the `cumulus` user**.

Note that due to the way we simulate the out of band network, it is not possible
to use `vagrant ssh` to access in-band devices like leaf01 and leaf02. These
devices **must** be accessed via the out-of-band management server.

### How are IP addresses Allocated?
The [Reference Topology](#what-is-the-reference-topology) only specifies the IP addresses used in the Out-of-Band network
for maximum flexibility when creating new demos. To see the IP address allocation for the
Out-of-Band Network check the [IPAM diagram](./documentation/ipam.md)

### Tips on Managing the VMs in the Topology
The topology built using this Vagrantfile does not support `vagrant halt` or
`vagrant resume` for in-band devices. To resume working with the demos at a later point in time, use 
the hypervisor's halt and resume functionality.

In Virtualbox this can be done inside of the GUI by powering off (and later powering-on) the devices 
involved in the simulation or by running the following CLI commands:

    * VBoxManage controlvm leaf01 poweroff
    * VBoxManage startvm leaf01 --type headless

When using the libvirt/kvm hypervisor the following commands can be used:

    * virsh destroy cldemo-vagrant_leaf01
    * virsh start cldemo-vagrant_leaf01


#### Factory-reset a device

    vagrant destroy -f leaf01
    vagrant up leaf01


#### Destroy the entire topology

    vagrant destroy -f

### Can I Preserve My Configuration
In order to keep your configuration across Vagrant sessions, you should either save your configuration
in a repository using an automation tool such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef (preferred) or alternatively 
copy the configuration files off of the VMs before running the "vagrant destroy" command to remove and 
destroy the VMs involved in the simulation.

One helpful command for saving configuration from Cumulus devices is:

    net show configuration files

or 

    net show configuration command

**This command will not show configuration for third-party applications.**

### How Can I Customize the Topology?
This Vagrant topology is built using [Topology Converter](https://github.com/cumulusnetworks/topology_converter).
To create your own arbitrary topology, we recommend using Topology Converter. This will create a new 
Vagrantfile which is specific to your environment.For more details on how to make customized 
topologies, read Topology Converter's [documentation](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/topology_converter/tree/master/documentation).

#### **Advanced Users ONLY: ** Editing the existing topology
This can be a bit tricky, to edit the existing topologies you can bring in the required portions of [Topology Converter](https://github.com/cumulusnetworks/topology_converter) needed to get the job done.
The process looks like what is featured below and is also found in the `build.sh` script used to rebuild and update this environment.

    vagrant destroy -f
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CumulusNetworks/topology_converter/master/topology_converter.py
    mkdir ./templates/
    wget -O ./templates/Vagrantfile.j2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CumulusNetworks/topology_converter/master/templates/Vagrantfile.j2
    # edit topology.dot as desired
    python topology_converter.py topology.dot


## Quick Start:
Before running this demo or any of the other demos in the list below, install
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds) and
[Vagrant](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/).

**NOTE: On Windows, if you have HyperV enabled, you will need to disable it as it will
conflict with Virtualbox's ability to create 64-bit VMs.**

### Provision the Topology and Log-in

    git clone https://github.com/cumulusnetworks/cldemo-vagrant
    cd cldemo-vagrant
    vagrant up oob-mgmt-server oob-mgmt-switch leaf01
    vagrant ssh oob-mgmt-server
    ssh leaf01
